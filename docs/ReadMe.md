# Changes in Week4 
## Domain Layer
1. I changed the User class to be more descriptive to what is intended UserCredenitals
2. I similarly changed the Customer class to have a filed for customerCredentials which is of the type UserCredentials (This seems better than extending the user class)
3. I added a class for FlightSearchCriteria in order to be able to store flight searches (I though I might need this in the future to add additional use cases or additional priorities for filtering flights based on  customer selected options such as only show direct flights or only show flights during this time frame)


# Week 4 Assignment
##Create a business layer manager that provides the logic for executing your highest priority use cases that makes use of the service layer factory and services, and makes use of domain objects.
##Implement a unit test that tests the functionality of the business layer fa√ßade.
##Implement a test suite for aggregating the business layer tests.
##Create a manager supertype that provides the behavior for getting services.
##Refactor your manager facades to extend the manager supertype and use the getting services method.
##Implement a test suite that aggregates the entire application.

# TODO
1. I'd like to have the system generate the Ids (I have used the database to do this in the past)
2. I need to think about whether I need the isUnique on the user class

# Thoughts
Should I add a new domain class to store criteria? 
What controls do I need?
   unique userNames
   get flights based on criteria within range of criteria
   aggregate itineraries for a customer
